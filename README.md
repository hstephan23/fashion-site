# Fashion By BHIG

### Description

This is a fashion blog and ecommerce site. There are still some portions that are under develop, but the major components are developed. The purpose of the site is for users to have one location to be able to read fashion articles, post about fashion articles, and make purchases of clothing items. The goal in this site is to learn about the MERN technologies through using them to build a functional website. Stripe is used for the checkout, but it is a test account, so no real data is being collected. 

The site relies on many technologies and the link to the deployed site can be found [here](https://fashion-site.onrender.com/login)

## Usage
This program is open source and only intended to be used for the practicing of MERN stack and authentication. The .env file should look like this:
